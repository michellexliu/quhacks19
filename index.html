                    <button class="accordion">What is a Hackathon?</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>A hackathon is a coding marathon - it's like a real-time programming fair where students develop an idea and bring it to life through code. A project could be a game, website, app, robot, Arduino project, whatever! If you enjoy programming or technology in general, hackathons are great places to meet friendly, like-minded people.</p>
                    </div>
                    <button class="accordion">Do I need to know how to code?</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>No, you don't! Even if you aren't able to code beforehand, you can attend workshops, learn some code, and still submit a project.</p>
                    </div>
                    <button class="accordion">Who can attend?</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>Participation is limited to students currently enrolled in high school and middle school students above the age of 13. If you have already graduated high school but would still like to attend the event, please consider volunteering or mentoring for the event!

                <div class="faq" id="faq">
                    <button class="accordion">What should I bring?</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>We recommend that you bring a laptop (One per team is fine). Laptops aren't required, but it won't be easy to code on lined paper.</p>
                    </div>
                    <button class="accordion">Can I use past projects?</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>Anyone caught working on past projects will be forced to sit in the corner and wear the dunce hat. Seriously though, don't be that one guy.</p>
                    </div>
                    <button class="accordion">What if I don't have a team?</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>No problem! Many participants arrive without a team, and you can meet and work with new people. You can also choose to work alone. The limit is 4 people per team.</p>

                    <button class="accordion">Who's Freddy?</button>
                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>At some point, Freddy had a cheesy description here. However, we can't seem to decide what Freddy is, so we'll just say he's that one duck you keep seeing around incomplete parts of this website.</p>
